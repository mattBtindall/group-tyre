        Engineers design all aspects of the vehicle to work together perfectly. Homologated (or OE) tyres are engineered in conjunction with the car manufacturers to ensure they work perfectly with the characteristics of the vehicle to give the driving experience the car designer wanted. As vehicles become more advanced OE tyres need to keep pace. From conception to production this process can take up to 2 years which is why tyres should always be replaced with ‘like for like’ original equipment products. OE tyres remain just as important on older vehicles as well as new ones. As the car ages more things can co wrong and tyres are the only point of contact the vehicle has with the road.  Different vehicle manufacturers signify OE fitments with different codes with some examples being:
