        An area the size of four outstretched hands is the only contact the vehicle has with the road. For a vehicle travelling at 30mph the tyreâ€™s contact patch has only fourteen hundredths of a second to do its job, that is why it is vital that tyres are correctly inflated, in great condition and have plenty of tread depth.
