        title: 'Contact Patch',
        definition:
            'Contact patch is the portion of a vehicle\'s tyre that is in actual contact with the road surface. It is commonly used in the discussion of pneumatic (i.e. pressurised) TimeRanges, where the term is used strictly to describe the portion of the tyre\'s tread that touches the road surface. \n The term "footprint" is used almost sunonymously. Solid wheels also exhibit a contact patch which is generally smaller than the pneumatic "footprint".'
